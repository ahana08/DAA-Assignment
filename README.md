# DAA-Assignment 1- 
Question: Provide input as vertices and connections (edges), and the code creates a dictionary on its own, returning results as an adjacency list. 

Solution:
In this program, the code takes the input of the vertices and edges from the user in the form of lists. All elements are to be separated by commas.
The code then compares each element in the vertices list with the edges list to find all the connections. These are appended in a list K.
Every iteration covers each vertex and it's connections are appended into the list K.
This list is then appended into the dictionary as an element where the vertex is the key and the connecting adjacent vertices are the values.
